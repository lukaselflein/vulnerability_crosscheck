# Is my installed software vulnerable?
## Background
Modern workstations have a surprisingly large ecosystem of apps, libraries and drivers - many of them not directly installed, but only installed as a dependency of some other program. Most of these components are vulnerable, i.e. they contain bugs or misconfigurations that make them great places to attack the computer.

The basic countermeasure is to keep software in packages to manage the complexity, and keep these packages updated.

While this usually works, what if you can't update something because otherwise dependencies will be broken? What if you don't trust your packet manager to always get the newest/most secure versions?

## Crosscheck installed and vulnerable software
Luckily, there are databases of all known exploits and vulnerabilities. In this project, I use one of them (NVD, based on the CVE db) to check for vulnerabilities in my old linux mint system.

This has the following components:
1. Get a list of all installed software
2. Get a list of all known vulnerabilities
3. Check which of the installed software is vulnerable

## Dependencies
To run this analysis, you need:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
pip install jupyterlab json pandas numpy urllib gzip os --user
```

## Run it
Download the repo with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaselflein/vulnerability_crosscheck
```
and run the main script
```bash
jupyter-notebook string_matches_vuln_crosscheck.ipynb
```
